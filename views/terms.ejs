                        <h3>22. Our responsibility to you</h3>
                        <p>
                            The AI Hedge Service allows you to purchase services and products, and provides you with content and information that are owned or developed by third parties, or that operate on or are supported by third party networks. As we do not have any control over these services or products that you purchase, or content you view using the AI Hedge Service, we are not responsible for them in any way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While we do our best to ensure that the features and functionalities of the AI Hedge Service are of a reasonably satisfactory standard and are available to you all of the time, certain features may rely on networks and connections that are beyond our control. Due to the nature of the Internet and technology, the AI Hedge Service is therefore provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. As such, we cannot guarantee that the AI Hedge Service won't be interrupted, or that you will not experience delays, failures or errors when using the AI Hedge Service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also give no guarantee as to the fitness for purpose of the AI Hedge Service for your specific needs. To the extent we are able to do so, we exclude any commitments that may be implied by law. For any claim, our responsibility to you will be limited to any amounts you have paid us in the 12 months preceding your claim. If you have not paid us anything, we shall not be responsible to you for any claim arising out of the provision of the AI Hedge Service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In every case, we will never be responsible for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable, or that is caused by a failure by you to comply with these Terms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes we might be entitled to be compensated by you, for instance due to a technical error in your favor, when you have a negative balance on your account, or when you use the AI Hedge Service in such a way that violates the Terms. In such cases, we shall be entitled to recover any sum due to us by retaining some or all of your available funds or balances that you have stored in your AI Hedge Multi-currency Account or crypto-assets you have bought through the AI Hedge Service, regardless of what currency or crypto-assets those balances are held in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where necessary, we will convert currencies and crypto-assets at the applicable exchange rate.
