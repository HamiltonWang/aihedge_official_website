                        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                        <p>version 1.0 2021-08-26</p>
                        <p>Our mission is to bring various AI Trading Strategies built in-house or by alliance to the public through our Dapp.</p>
                        <p>This project has two stages.</p>

                        <p>First is the AI Bot that learns from data and learns to trade automatically and continues to learn from incoming new data.</p>

                        <p>The second part of the project is to build a Dapp that serves as a wallet and enables the masses to invest and withdraw their cryptocurrencies, such as USDT or ETH by using the Dapp.</p>

                        <p>All the transactions of cryptocurrencies flow are on the chain so there is no dispute of the flow of cryptocurrencies that are being deposited. 
                            Besides, all the investments (we call it strategy from now) prices are stored in Oracle, so every up and down are clearely shown like regular stock market or fund. A fee is consumed everytime a user tries to make an investment and it is the secondary source of income to support and maintain this Dapp.</p>
                        <p>The concept is simple but is difficult to implement due to the treacherous nature of cryptocurrency and the US stock market. 
                            But we are able to integrate new strategies from the alliance into our Dapp so that the system can be continuously run forever as long as there are smart, talented, and insightful traders who are willing to join in. And in fact, there are many of them scattered all around the world waiting to be found.</p>

                    <div class="single-features" id="introduction">
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>We believe the convergence of decentralized finance, especially in the investment vertical, and decentralized finance (DeFi), will unlock billions of dollars in value that we intend to capture as part of the AI Hedge Dapp and ecosystem.</p>

                        <p>To get there, we will bring blockchain-enabled commerce and finance to the masses. We will continue to improve AI hedge products to enable new killer use cases that are only made possible by cryptocurrency technologies.
                            To start, we will take advantage of Ethereum Smart Contracts to build new commerce experiences that cannot be replicated on incumbent platforms like Shopify, Amazon, or Alibaba.</p>
                            
                        <p>In 2020 alone, over billions of cryptocurrencies changed hands, with most of that occurring over recent years.
                            The rate of growth in new Ethereum technologies such as NFT further boots trade volume and the rate of innovation in the space is exponential.
                            Top cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Uniswap have already gotten involved for quite some time, and everyone from Andreessen Horowitz to the New York Times is investing in or commenting on Ethereum products such as smart contracts and NFTs.
                            There are also game changers such as Polkastarter have the potential to disrupt the venture capital industry.
                            Smart Contract and AI both represent a massive disruptive opportunity that can touch virtually every aspect of global investment opportunity.</p>
                            
                        <p>In addition, we will make it dead simple for mainstream consumers to participate in the DeFi investment strategy and
                            We can add yield-earning strategies when we gather more momentum.
                            Investors and lenders should be earning yields at 10 to 20 times (10–20%) what is offered currently by traditional banking systems.
                            Furthermore, this all needs to happen in frictionless and easy ways that are in stark contrast to the product experiences of today’s first-generation DeFi app.</p>
                            
                        <p>Cryptocurrency transactions and mini-batch investments need to be made far simpler than they are today.
                            We need to propagate cryptocurrency investment and payment rails that are superior to existing traditional credit cards and mobile payments that rely on fiat currencies and centralized systems.</p>
                            
                        <p>To realize our vision, we will continue to develop and grow the AI Hedge Dollar (AIUSD) as a critical DeFi building block and money lego that is highly composable.
                            We anticipate millions of users to be using applications powered by AIUSD in the next few years without necessarily even realizing they are using an underlying DeFi product.</p>

                            they cannot get from existing alternatives. 
                            Many of these early users will be crypto natives. </p>
